# Custom Model Providers

climatextract ships with reference Azure AI Foundry and Azure OpenAI Service adapters. To use a different LLM or embedding provider — OpenAI direct, Anthropic, a local model, anything else — implement a handler and pass it to `extract()`.

We purposefully built our software using [liteLLM's Python SDK](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/learn/sdk_quickstart) to make switching between different model providers as easy as possible.

---

## When you need this

Reach for a custom handler when:

- You want to use a provider the bundled Azure adapters don't cover.
- You want to use Azure but need behavior the bundled adapters don't expose.
- You're running models locally and don't want to go through a cloud provider at all.

If you just want to tweak parameters on an Azure model (temperature, reasoning effort, concurrency), you can instantiate `AzureAIFoundryLlmHandler` or `AzureOpenAILlmHandler` directly without subclassing — see [Running Extraction](running-extraction.md#using-a-custom-llm-or-embedding-provider).

---

## The interfaces

If you need access to models outside Azure, you will need to implement two subclasses. The abstract base classes in [`climatextract.llm_embedding_api_bridge`](https://github.com/gist-sustainability/climatextract/blob/main/climatextract/llm_embedding_api_bridge.py) define the contract.

### `LlmHandler(ABC)`

Subclasses must implement:

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `get_completion_and_cost(messages)` | Sync call. Takes OpenAI-style `messages` list, returns `(response, cost_in_usd)`. |
| `aget_completion_and_cost(messages)` | Async version of the above. |
| `get_model_dict()` | Returns a dict describing the model (must include a `"model"` key — used for logging and `repr`). |
| `get_max_concurrent_calls()` | Returns the max number of parallel calls the wrapper's semaphore should allow (used with the async method mentioned before). |

The returned `response` should be shaped like an OpenAI chat completion — specifically, `response.choices[0].message.content` (for the output text), `response.choices[0].logprobs` (optional), and `response.usage.prompt_tokens` / `response.usage.completion_tokens`. LiteLLM's `ModelResponse` already matches this shape, as do OpenAI SDK responses.

### `EmbeddingModelHandler(ABC)`

Subclasses must implement:

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `get_embedding_and_cost(texts)` | Sync call. Takes `list[str]`, returns `(response, cost_in_usd)`. |
| `aget_embedding_and_cost(texts)` | Async version. |
| `get_model_dict()` | Dict with a `"model"` key. |
| `get_max_concurrent_calls()` | Max parallel embedding calls (used with the async method mentioned before). |

The returned `response` should expose `response.data` as a sequence of items with an `embedding` field (either attribute- or dict-style — both are handled), and `response.usage.prompt_tokens`.

## Minimal example: OpenAI direct

An LLM handler that uses the OpenAI SDK directly, no LiteLLM:

```python
import os
from typing import Tuple
from openai import AsyncOpenAI, OpenAI

from climatextract.llm_embedding_api_bridge import LlmHandler


class OpenAILlmHandler(LlmHandler):
    def __init__(self, model: str = "gpt-4o-mini", max_concurrent_calls: int = 8):
        self.model = model
        self._max = max_concurrent_calls
        self._client = OpenAI(api_key=os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"])
        self._aclient = AsyncOpenAI(api_key=os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"])

    def get_model_dict(self) -> dict:
        return {"model": self.model}

    def get_max_concurrent_calls(self) -> int:
        return self._max

    def get_completion_and_cost(self, messages: list[dict]) -> Tuple[object, float]:
        response = self._client.chat.completions.create(model=self.model, messages=messages)
        return response, 0.0  # compute your own cost if you need it

    async def aget_completion_and_cost(self, messages: list[dict]) -> Tuple[object, float]:
        response = await self._aclient.chat.completions.create(model=self.model, messages=messages)
        return response, 0.0
```

Pass it to `extract()`:

```python
from climatextract import extract

result_path = extract("./data/pdfs/", llm=OpenAILlmHandler(model="gpt-4o-mini"))
```

## Our implementations

### Using liteLLM with Azure AI Foundry

As another example, you should explore our adapters for the Azure AI Foundry, [`climatextract/adapters/azure_ai_foundry.py`](https://github.com/gist-sustainability/climatextract/blob/main/climatextract/adapters/azure_ai_foundry.py). `class AzureAIFoundryLlmHandler` implements the `LlmHandler`, and `AzureAIFoundryEmbeddingHandler` implements the `EmbeddingModelHandler`.

Note that we load model configuration parameters from the configuration file [`climatextract.toml`](configuration.md)

### Using liteLLM with OpenRouter.ai

If you like to use models from openrouter.ai, create an API key on their platform and put it in your `.env`:
```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
```

Then import [`climatextract/adapters/openrouter.py`](https://github.com/gist-sustainability/climatextract/blob/main/climatextract/adapters/openrouter.py)

```python
from climatextract.adapters.openrouter import OpenRouterLlmHandler
from climatextract import extract

llm = OpenRouterLlmHandler(extra_body={
            "provider": {'quantizations': ['fp8'], "only": ["StreamLake", "NovitaAI", "BaiduQianfan"], "sort": "price"}})

result_path = extract("./data/pdfs/", llm=llm)
```

The `extra_body`-parameter is from liteLLM and its contents are passed directly to OpenRouter. Here you select which provider will serve your model (only models with fp8-quantization from certain model providers, who need to serve the model you like to run, cheapest first). See the [Openrouter documentation](https://openrouter.ai/docs/guides/routing/provider-selection) for provider selection.

Model configuration parameters are again set at the configuration file [`climatextract.toml`](configuration.md), e.g.

```toml
[models]
# the postfix `:floor` prefers low-price model providers
llm_model = "z-ai/glm-5.2:floor"
reasoning_effort = "high"
temperature = 0.0
return_logprobs = true

# If the value is too high, you will see RateLimitErrors (code 429) from the upstream model provider
max_parallel_llm_prompts_running = 20
```

## Notes

- **Don't manage concurrency inside your handler.** The `Llm` / `EmbeddingModel` wrapper already applies a semaphore sized by `get_max_concurrent_calls()`.
- **Don't count tokens or cost inside your handler beyond returning them.** The wrapper records them via `UsageCounter` and surfaces them in `logs.json` and MLflow.
- **Cost is optional.** Return `0.0` if your provider doesn't give you a price back. The pipeline will still run.
- **Reference implementations.** For more complete examples — routing, Azure AD token handling, per-model parameter quirks — see [`climatextract/adapters/azure_ai_foundry.py`](https://github.com/gist-sustainability/climatextract/blob/main/climatextract/adapters/azure_ai_foundry.py) and [`climatextract/adapters/azure_openai.py`](https://github.com/gist-sustainability/climatextract/blob/main/climatextract/adapters/azure_openai.py).
- **Subclass instead of write from scratch.** If you only need to tweak one or two things (e.g., an extra request param), subclassing `AzureAIFoundryLlmHandler` or `AzureOpenAILlmHandler` and overriding `__init__` is usually enough.
